# Reviewable Custom Styles

## To Develop

Run the `npm run dev` command to run postcss transforms and then `npm run serve` (uses `sirv-cli` to serve `dist`). Then, paste `https://localhost:8081/dark-mode.css` or whatever custom url into the user settings in Reviewable (production or dev).

Happy customizing!
